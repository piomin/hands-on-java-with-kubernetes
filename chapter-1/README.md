# Java with Kubernetes in Action

## Chapter 1: Run First Applications on Kubernetes

This directory contains two simple applications written in Spring Boot ([sample-spring-k8s-ch1](sample-spring-k8s-ch1)) and Quarkus ([sample-quarkus-k8s-ch1](sample-quarkus-k8s-ch1)). You can build and run them using Maven and easily deploy to Kubernetes.

Detailed description can be found in the book.
